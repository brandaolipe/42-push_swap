## Description

The **push_swap** project is an algorithmic challenge whose goal is to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations and an auxiliary stack.

The program receives a list of integers as arguments and must output the smallest possible sequence of operations to sort them in ascending order. Only predefined operations are allowed, such as swapping elements, pushing between stacks, and rotating stacks.

The main challenge of this project is to design an efficient sorting strategy that minimizes the number of operations, especially for large input sizes.
